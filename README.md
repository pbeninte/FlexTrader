# FlexTrader

# Overview
This project is a multi-task trading algorithm that utilizes various reinforcement learning techniques such as DQN, DDQN, Actor-Critic, and Policy Gradient to trade on the futures market. The algorithm is implemented using the Interactive Brokers API and TensorFlow.


# Requirements

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
IB API (ib_insync)
pandas
numpy
matplotlib


# Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine
Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the train.py file to train the algorithm on the specified task (DQN, DDQN, Actor-Critic, or Policy Gradient)
Use the Trader class to execute trades on the market using the trained model


# Note

This project is intended for educational and research purposes only. The results and performance of the algorithm may not be indicative of actual trading performance.
